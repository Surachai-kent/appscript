TO DO

- improve error reporting; e.g. pack/unpack errors in aem/codecs.rb could have better descriptions and/or represented by a TypeError(?) class

- pack/unpack support for application types

- what constants need to be added to kae.rb?

  typeKernelProcessID = 'kpid',
  typeMachPort = 'port'
  typeApplicationBundleID = 'bund'

  'csig' enums

  Attribute keys:
  'cons' # ignore text attributes
  'csig' # consider/ignore text attributes
  'subj' # subject attribute

  see if it's poss. to regenerate from header files


- Connect.local_app_by_pid can just use an AEDesc of typeKernelProcessID

- allow users to extract a generic ref from a real ref (to_generic) for comparison purposes. Or vice-versa?

- implement built-in help system by bridging to py-appscript

- see if it's possible to work better with irb's autocomplete (autocomplete support is currently limited to start of a reference)

- ae/aem/appscript-defined exception classes aren't quite idiomatic Ruby

- finish commenting source code

- would be nice if MacFile::FileNotFoundError always showed the failed path (this'd need a bit of Alias Manager glue added to the ae extension)

- include an example project (or source for) that uses ruby2exe to build a standalone 'applet'

- MacTypes::Alias, MacTypes::FileURL should support ==, eql? and hash

- profiling

- finish writing tests

- finish problem apps chapter (see comments in HTML file)

- see also TO DO items in source files

- see also py-appscript's todo.txt file
