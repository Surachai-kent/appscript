TO DO

- figure out how to create top-level app, con, its functions that work correctly; right now, defining:

require "appscript"
def app(*args)
	AS.app(*args)
end

produces reference objects okay, but these objects' to_s method returns empty strings instead of correct representation

- allow users to extract a generic ref from a real ref (to_generic) for comparison purposes. Or vice-versa?

- improve error reporting; e.g. pack/unpack errors in aem/codecs.rb could have better descriptions and/or represented by a CodecsError class; ae/aem/appscript-defined exception classes aren't quite idiomatic Ruby

- profiling

- see about getting a Window Manager connection in command-line ruby interpreter to allow dialog osaxen to display

- check if eight-char-codes (event names) are 2x32-bit words or 1x64-bit word; codecs module currently assumes the former

- remote AEs seem a little glitchy

- finish commenting source code

- change Alias.at, FileURL.at to Alias.to, FileURL.to/Alias.for, FileURL.for?

- add bigger note about UTF8 usage to manual, useful tips (e.g. jcode), etc.

- would be nice if MacFile::FileNotFoundError always showed the failed path (this'd need a bit of Alias Manager glue added to the ae extension)

- MacFile objects should support ==, eql? and hash

- finish writing tests

- port aem, findapp manuals
