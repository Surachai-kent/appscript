TO DO

- improve error reporting; e.g. pack/unpack errors in aem/codecs.rb could have better descriptions and/or represented by a CodecsError class; ae/aem/appscript-defined exception classes aren't quite idiomatic Ruby

- pack/unpack support for application types

- any other types to add to defaultterminology.rb?


- allow users to extract a generic ref from a real ref (to_generic) for comparison purposes. Or vice-versa?

- implement built-in help system by bridging to py-appscript

- see if it's possible to work better with irb's autocomplete (autocomplete support is currently limited to start of a reference)

- finish commenting source code

- would be nice if MacFile::FileNotFoundError always showed the failed path (this'd need a bit of Alias Manager glue added to the ae extension)

- include an example project (or source for) that uses ruby2exe to build a standalone 'applet'

- MacTypes::Alias, MacTypes::FileURL should support ==, eql? and hash

- profiling

- finish writing tests

- port aem, findapp manuals

- see also py-appscript's todo.txt file
