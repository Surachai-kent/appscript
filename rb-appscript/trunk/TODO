TO DO

- see if there's a way to provide a SafeObject base class for Appscript::Reference and Appscript::GenericReference that doesn't depend on inserting callbacks into Module (or are Rubyists fine with the current approach?)

- see if it's possible to work better with irb's autocomplete (autocomplete support is currently limited to start of a reference; not sure why)

- ae/aem/appscript-defined exception classes aren't quite idiomatic Ruby

- any additional tests

- improve/polish documentation

- see also TO DO comments in rbae.c

-------

- _aem/connect.rb module refers directly to Send::Event instead of going via the AEM::Application::Event hook, which might cause problems when used in an OSA component or other situation where client needs to customise all event creation and/or dispatch.

- support sending and receiving events on non-main threads

- provide an example project (or source for) that uses ruby2exe to build a standalone 'applet'

- any more built-in Ruby class<->AE type converters needed?

- in AEM::CommandError, extract and report any kOSA... error parameters, if present

- implement built-in help by bridging to osadict
