TO DO

- see if there's a way to provide a SafeObject base class for Appscript::Reference and Appscript::GenericReference that doesn't require adding traps to Module. (e.g. Could an alternative base class be implemented in C to act as a buffer between the two?)

- implement built-in help system by bridging to py-appscript

- see if it's possible to work better with irb's autocomplete (autocomplete support is currently limited to start of a reference)

- ae/aem/appscript-defined exception classes aren't quite idiomatic Ruby

- would be nice if MacFile::FileNotFoundError always showed the failed path (this'd need a bit of Alias Manager glue added to the ae extension)

- include an example project (or source for) that uses ruby2exe to build a standalone 'applet'

- profiling

- finish writing tests

- improve and polish documentation

- finish problem apps chapter (see comments in HTML file)

- see also TO DO items in source files

- see also py-appscript's todo.txt file
