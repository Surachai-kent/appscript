TO DO

- can numbers in range (2**63)..(2**64 - 1) safely be packed as typeUInt64 on 10.5+? Or stick with packing those as lossy 64-bit floating point for compatibility?

- _aem/connect.rb module refers directly to Send::Event instead of going via the AEM::Application::Event hook, which might cause problems when used in an OSA component or other situation where client needs to customise all event creation and/or dispatch.

- support string encodings in Ruby 1.9

- document extended error info methods

- add compatibility flag to AppData for unpacking typeLongDateTime descs as Date instead of Time instances (the latter has limited range)

- fix strict warnings in Ruby 1.9.1
