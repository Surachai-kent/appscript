osascript is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities (a.k.a. Distutils). To install osascript, cd to the osascript-0.x.x directory and run:

	python setup.py install

Setuptools will be used if available, otherwise the setup.py script will revert to distutils.

Building osascript from source requires the gcc compiler (supplied with Apple's Developer Tools). Setuptools is available from <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi>.

osascript requires MacPython 2.3 or later and Mac OS X 10.3 or later.
