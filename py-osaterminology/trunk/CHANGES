2010-12-19 -- 0.14.5

- fixed objc-appscript memory leak caused by missing -release in -[<PREFIX>Application initWithTargetType:data:] glue; updated glue version to 0.5.3

- eliminated aem.ae.getappterminology dependencies as this function is removed in appscript 0.22.0+

- fixed (hopefully) sdef-related bugs in dom.sdefparser, osadictionary

- replaced quickdoc app, component functions with renderaetes


2009-12-17 -- 0.14.4

- updated to use py-appscript 0.21.0

- fixed bug in makeidentifier where bad keywords were not always adequately escaped

2009-06-14 -- 0.14.3

- fixed dom.aeteparser, tables.tablebuilder so that application-defined property/element names that overlap built-in type/enum/property names but use different codes are now consistently escaped in both references and keywords; e.g. k.rotation_, someobj.rotation_. (Note: this fix has still to be made in dom.sdefparser.)

- kludged a fix into osadictionary so that [e.g.] asdict Mail -r doesn't fail due to problems with Type/Class distinction and visible/hidden support

2008-12-01 -- 0.14.2

- fixed argument types for -at:, -at:to:, -initWithPID: in makeglue/objcappscript.py (now int, pid_t; previously declared as long)


2008-11-11 -- 0.14.1

- added py-appscript 0.19.0 support
- added default definitions for 'item' type, 'items' elements, 'properties' property as Apple have removed the 'item' class definition from skeleton.sdef (the default terminology for Cocoa apps)
- added makeglue.objcappscript

2008-08-14 -- 0.13.0

- restructured makeidentifier module as sub-package to make it easier to maintain (note: users must manually delete any older non-egg osaterminology installations from site-packages/aeosa before installing this version)
- updated reserved keywords for objc-appscript
- fixed bug in tables.tablebuilder (would raise encoding error if four-char-codes contained non-ASCII chars)

2008-07-12 -- 0.12.0
- moved to py-osaterminology project
- updated to use py-appscript 0.19.0+
- removed getterminology package; clients should use aem.ae extension's GetAppTerminology/GetSysTerminology/CopyScriptingDefinition functions directly for now (note that these behave slightly differently to getaete/getaeut/getsdef, raising aem.ae.MacOSError -192 if no terminology resource found)
- organised default terminology modules into new 'defaultterminology' package
- added tables package
- other structural improvements

2007-12-20 -- 0.11.0
- added 'isrunning'/'is_running?'/'isRunning' to reserved py-/rb-/objc-appscript keywords
- rearranged some module imports in dom.aeteparser, dom.sdefparser as they were causing errors in ASDictionary
- added 'as' to reserved py-appscript keywords as it doesn't appear in Python's own keyword.kwlist before Python 2.5; existing Python 2.3/2.4 scripts should be updated as necessary
- fixed bugs in renderers.typerenderers
- changed 'AEMType', 'AEMEnum' names to 'ASType', 'ASEnum' in renderers.typerenderers

2007-07-26 -- 0.10.4
- sax.aeteparser no longer raises error if aete isn't fully parsed

2007-06-30 -- 0.10.3

- changed AERegistry-style keywords to AS-style (e.g. k.MissingValue -> k.missing_value)
- getaeut now always returns a list of str
- sdefparser no longer errors on AE codes containing non-ASCII characters (now converts parsed AE codes from unicode to MacRoman-encoded strings)
- improved relationship renderer's presentation and performance

2006-08-26 -- 0.9.2

- htmldoc now renders properties and elements where corresponding class/enum defintion is missing as raw AE codes
- osadictionary now correctly cleans duplicate elements when getting collapsed/full Class definitions
- circular inheritance between classes no longer causes infinite recursion when cleaning Class objects

2006-08-16 -- 0.9.1
