TO DO

- finish osadictionary implementation

- osadictionary.Element needs a method for determining if accessor forms are known or inferred

- add functions for escaping/formatting AE codes as ASCII/identifiers to makeidentifier

- note that OSACopyScriptingDefinition will omit hidden class and command definitions (bug id 4677156)

- anything else

- wonder if we should provide default appscript definitions for text, character, word, paragraph and other keywords that may be omitted from dictionary, but only pull them in when actually needed?

- note that TextWrangler's Text Suite has dodgy definitions (properties and elements are listed under plural, not singular, definitions; there's no singular form for the 'text' class so aeteparser won't recognise it)

- re. node visibility, maybe use enum {kVisible, kHidden, kLimited} instead of bool, where kLimited = node that doesn't have its own hidden flag set but lies within another node that does, so may be visible in limited circumstances. That way, classes/enums in tpnm suite could still be treated as visible within certain contexts (e.g. property/parameter types) while not appearing in others (e.g. collapsed class definitions). 

Note that dom.aeteparser has temporary patches to partially work around this issue for now (e.g. 'owner privileges' properties type appears in htmldoc output, even though its an Enumeration defined in tpnm suite and therefore marked as hidden by parser).

A postscript: as it turns out, I've subsequently discovered PyOSA as it currently exists won't work for my current use case.  Silly me - I hadn't realized that the third-party app, EagleFiler, with which I wanted to use python script handlers, is itself written in Python and apparently packaged with py2app.  In particular, it has its own private Python framework in the app bundle.  Noting in the code that PyOSA tries to handle that case but mainly just to satisfy my curiosity, I played around with it a bit, going as far as to install py-appscript and friends into its private site-packages.zip

You can install PyOSA-specific modules at:

	~/Library/PyOSA/2.x/site-packages
	/Library/PyOSA/2.x/site-packages

(where '2.x' is the Python version and sub-version, e.g. 2.5).
but then ran into the dead end of PyOSA being unable to bind to that framework ("Couldn't bind PyArg_ParseTuple") due to stripped binaries I gather.

Odd. I know that py2app strips redundant modules, but I wouldn't have thought it'd affect the Python binary. Did you ask Bob about this? It's not something I have time to investigate myself, but if I knew exactly what the problem was I might be able to provide a patch. As you say, PyOSA is meant to cope with this sort of scenario.


You were right to be skeptical about my lazy assumptions.

So.... After delving much deeper into it, it turns out that the root cause of that symptom was that the app bundle's private Python.framework did not have the customary symlinks to Python and Resources.

	nad@fimt:/Applications/EagleFiler.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework$ ls -l
	total 16
	drwxr-xr-x  3 nad  admin  102 Mar 11 10:28 Versions

versus a normal Python framework build:

	nad@fimt:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework$ ls -l
	total 24
	lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin   24 Feb 23 15:45 Headers -> Versions/Current/Headers
	lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin   23 Feb 23 15:45 Python -> Versions/Current/Python
	lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin   26 Feb 23 15:45 Resources -> Versions/Current/Resources
	drwxr-xr-x  3 root  admin  136 Feb 21 23:00 Versions

That's why createPythonFramework in pythonloader.c was not able to find the Python binary to bind to in the app's existing Python framework.  As a workaround, I manually added the symlinks for Python and Resources within the app's bundle and that got it past the binding issue but on to a much more serious problem.  More on that in a moment.

Since EagleFile.app appears to be created with py2app, I created a sample test app with py2app and noted that the app bundle also lacked the symlinks.  So there would seem to be two issues here: (1) should py2app be changed to create the symlinks? and (2) what, if anything, should PyOSA do to work around their lack in existing apps?

Moving on, with the symlinks in place, PyOSA initialization proceeds in createComponentInstanceStorage which calls addResourcesFolderToSysPath which calls PyImport_ImportModule (to import "sys") and down there in Python it crashes with what I assume to be a null pointer dereference, possibly _PyThread_GetFrame from PyEval_GetFrame in ceval.c from PyEval_GetGlobals from PyImport_Import from PyImport_ImportModule.  I don't see anything glaringly obvious - the crashed thread is the main app thread with a python instance initialized in the main app and no other python threads - but this certainly isn't my area of expertise.  Note that in the attached stack traces, PyOSA was built as a Debug target; the problem symptoms are the same with a standard Release target.  I was also able to reproduce the problem with identical results on a PPC G4 also running 10.5.2.

And that's where things stand.  I really can't put any more time into it right at the moment, though it's been a learning experience!

If you are interested in pursuing this further, here's a stripped-down test procedure:

0. Install PyOSA and appscript from svn trunk.

1. Download and install EagleFiler (free 30-day demo)
	<http://c-command.com/downloads/EagleFiler-1.3.dmg>

2. Launch EagleFiler.  Create New Library.

3. Launch Console.app. Launch Terminal.app.  With focus on Terminal.app window, press F1.  Note EF message "Capture Not Supported...".  Cancel and quit EF.

4. In Script Editor, create and compile a PyOSA script:
	def capture():
		print "Hello world"

  Save As.. [Run Only] to
    ~/Library/Application Support/EagleFiler/Capture Scripts/com.apple.Terminal.scpt

5. Launch EF. Focus on Terminal.app window, press F1.  Note EF message "AppleScript Compilation Error...".  Note in Console system.log "PyOSA Couldn't bind PyArg_ParseTuple".  Quit EF.

6. In terminal window:
	cd /Applications/EagleFiler.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework
	ln -s Versions/2.5/Python Python
	ln -s Versions/2.5/Resources Resources

7. Launch EF. Focus on Terminal.app window, press F1.  Note EF crash!



----> FWIW, the python embedded in the app is 2.5.1:
