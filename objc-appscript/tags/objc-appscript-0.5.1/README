About objc-appscript
====================

ObjC appscript (objc-appscript) is a high-level, user-friendly 
Apple event bridge that allows you to control AppleScriptable Mac OS X
applications from Objective-C.


Requirements
------------

- ObjC appscript supports Mac OS X 10.4 and later.

- ASDictionary 0.13.1 or later is required to generate application glues.


Installation
------------

The Xcode project provides a number of release build configurations:

- 32-bit for OS X 10.4+:

  Release_10.4_32 -- for installing in /Library/Frameworks
  
  Release_10.4_32_embed -- for embedding in .app bundles


- 32- & 64-bit with support for retain/release and garbage collection

  Release_10.5_32_64_GC -- for installing in /Library/Frameworks
  
  Release_10.5_32_64_GC_embed -- for embedding in .app bundles


Embedded builds are the same as regular builds, except that the
Installation Directory setting is @executable_path/../Frameworks
(i.e. the framework should be placed in YourApp.app/Contents/Frameworks).
