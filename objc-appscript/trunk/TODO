TO DO

======= appscript =======

- investigate four char code problem in FNGlue


======= aem/application.h =======

- in +processExistsForDescriptor:, what codes should indicate running? (e.g. -1712 = running but unresponsive)


======= aem/event.h =======

- check if kOSAErrorOffendingObject can be any type (the OSA API docs suggest that it may have to be an object specifier, but really aren't clear); currently, -sendWithError: returns anything for kAEMErrorOffendingObject when raising its own coercion error


======= miscellaneous =======

- compiler warnings when [ASApplicationObj run] is used:

	/Users/has/AppscriptDemo/AppscriptDemo.m:27: warning: multiple methods named '-run' found
	/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSRunLoop.h:37: warning: using '-(void)run'
	/Users/has/AppscriptDemo/TEGlue/TEReferenceGlue.h:55: warning: also found '-(TERunCommand *)run'


- finish documentation, header comments

- unit tests

- update reserved ObjC keywords in py-osaterminology
