TO DO

======= appscript =======

- implement all-in-one shortcuts for get, set commands? Some possibilities:

Basic get/set (note: names have 'Data' appended [c.f. keyAEGetData, keyAESetData] to help distinguish 'get' shortcut from normal -get method):

	-getData
	-getDataWithError:

	-setData:
	-setData:error:

	Example:

		// get text of document 1

		[[[[[textedit documents] at: 1] text] get] send]

		[[[[textedit documents] at: 1] text] getData]


Basic get/set, allowing client to specify the result type for 'get' (note: these methods may be preferable to the above - need to see what users prefer):

	-getAs:
	-getAs:error:
	-getAsListOf:
	-getAsListOf:error:

	-setTo:
	-setTo:error:

	Example:	

		// get text of documents as list of strings

		[[[[[textedit documents] text] get] returnListOfType: typeUnicodeText] send]

		[[[textedit documents] text] getListOf: typeUnicodeText]

Might also provide shortcuts for getting the most common types:

	-getAsObject
	-getAsString
	-getAsNumber
	-getAsList
	-getAsListOfString
	etc.

possibly with 'error:' variants instead of/as well:

	-getAsObjectWithError:
	-getAsListOfStringWithError:
	etc.


Might also provide shortcuts that return C ints and floats (note: any errors would be indicated by error arg only):

	-getAsIntWithError:
	-getAsUIntWithError:
	-getAsDoubleWithError:
	etc.

(Note: shortcuts that return C primitives will also be useful if osaglue provides a 'strict' option for commands where numerical and boolean parameters take C ints and floats rather than NSNumbers and AEMBooleans.)


- get developer feedback and suggestions on design of command attribute packing, e.g. should -existing -sendMode: method be augmented/replaced by task-specific methods, e.g. -waitReply/-queueReply/-ignoreReply, etc.


- -[ASCommand description] should provide appscript-style representation of command

Note: best way to do this might be to have codecs unpack event (TO DO) and then call -description on result; that way, appscript API can provide its own formatting without needing to create another error? Or would it be best just to wrap original AEM error in a new one?


- returnID support?; note: returnID is an argument to AECreateAppleEvent(), so the appscript layer would then need to avoid instantiating AEMEvent when a command is first called, allowing clients an opportunity to invoke -returnID: before adding attributes and parameters (including direct parameter and subject attribute).


- what to do if a command parameter is nil? raise error? ignore it? (Currently, if direct parameter is nil then it's ignored, but if a labelled parameter is nil AEMCodecs will raise an error.)


- include an appscript-style representation of Apple event in localizedDescription string of NSErrors returned by -[ASEvent sendWithError:], and/or include original event object in userInfo dictionary?


======= osaglue =======

- emptying py-appscript.terminology's default typebyname, typebycode tables means that type/enum/property name collisions between AEM and application won't be detected when generating XXConstant class; need to sort this

- finish py-appscript.terminology support (note: hooking osaglue into nominally private py-appscript code is not ideal; use objc-appscript's own aete parser when done)

- finish py-osaterminology support (should see about implementing a proper extensible plugin architecture)

- rename asglue


======= aem/application.h =======

- in +processExistsForDescriptor:, what codes should indicate running? (e.g. -1712 = running but unresponsive)


======= aem/event.h =======

- define formal protocol or abstract base class for AEMEvent class, as clients can install their own choice of event class in AEMApplication if they wish

- what to do if an AEMEvent attribute or parameter is nil? raise error? ignore it? (Currently, AEMCodecs will raise an error when it tries to pack the value.)

- -setParameter:forKeyword:, etc. should raise 'unexpected error' exception instead of returning nil

- check if kOSAErrorOffendingObject can be any type (the OSA API docs suggest that it may have to be an object specifier, but really aren't clear); currently, -sendWithError: returns anything for kAEMErrorOffendingObject when raising its own coercion error

- add the following methods to AEMEvent (note: scripting language wrappers will need this to render native representations):

	- (id)attributeForKeyword:(AEKeyword)key;
	- (id)parameterForKeyword:(AEKeyword)key;

	- (void)removeAttributeForKeyword:(AEKeyword)key;
	- (void)removeParameterForKeyword:(AEKeyword)key;

- include an aem-style representation of Apple event in localizedDescription string of NSErrors returned by -[AEMEvent sendWithError:], and/or include original event object in userInfo dictionary?

======= aem query builder =======

- comparison support

- AEMCustomRoot

- see also .h files

- eliminate minor risk of leaking memory due to race conditions in -packSelf: methods


======= aem type converter =======

- finish AEMCodecs specifier unpackers

- implement unit types support

- need to investigate ASFileSpec on 64-bit

Note: typeFSS is undefined in __LP64__, and AEDataModel.h states:

    FSSpecs are deprecated on Mac OS X, and their use in AppleEvents is discouraged.  You should change
    your code to use FSRefs.  In __LP64__ code, coercions into typeFSS is not supported,
    and coercion from typeFSS is not guaranteed to work correctly in all cases.


======= miscellaneous =======

- compiler warnings in 64-bit:

	/Users/has/appscript/objc-appscript/src/Appscript/types.m:255: warning: multiple methods named '-code' found
	/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSError.h:53: warning: using '-(NSInteger)code'
	/Users/has/appscript/objc-appscript/src/Appscript/types.h:141: warning: also found '-(OSType)code'

	/Users/has/appscript/objc-appscript/src/Appscript/parser.m:76: warning: multiple methods named '-code' found
	/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/NSError.h:53: warning: using '-(NSInteger)code'
	/Users/has/appscript/objc-appscript/src/Appscript/parser.h:23: warning: also found '-(OSType)code'


- NSErrors should include human-readable default error description; could use GetMacOSStatusCommentString if on 10.4 or later (see Debugging.h), otherwise will need to supply a lookup table for common Carbon error codes, c.f. rb-appscript. Probably also a good idea to include a lookup table for pre-Leopard Cocoa Scripting error strings, c.f. rb-appscript.

- i386 safety? 64-bit safety? GC (-finalize) support?

- provide convenience macros, e.g.: #AEMInt(index) [NSNumber numberWithInt: index]

- add 'strict' options for class and command generation to osaglue: -k option would create individual classes according to application dictionary; -c option would enforce type checking/coercion in command parameters and result. This would allow users to take advantage of ObjC static typing for applications whose dictionaries are sufficiently accurate to avoid compatibility problems.

- finish documentation, header comments
