TO DO

- note: emptying default typebyname, typebycode tables means that type/enum/property name collisions between AEM and application won't be detected when generating XXConstant class; need to sort this

- finish AEMCodecs specifier unpackers

- all-in-one shortcuts for get, set commands?

- get developer feedback and suggestions on design of command attribute packing and error reporting schemes

- i386 safety? 64-bit safety? GC (-finalize) support?

- finish appscript.terminology support

- finish osaterminology support (should see about implementing a proper extensible plugin architecture)

- provide convenience macro(s), e.g.:

	#AEMInt(index) [NSNumber numberWithInt: index]

- add 'strict' options for class and command generation to osaglue: -k option would create individual classes according to application dictionary; -c option would enforce type checking/coercion in command parameters and result. This would allow users to take advantage of ObjC static typing for applications whose dictionaries are sufficiently accurate to avoid compatibility problems.
