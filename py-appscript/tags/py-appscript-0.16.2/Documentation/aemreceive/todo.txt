TO DO

- allow lower-level event handlers to be installed, e.g. to allow request and reply events to be forwarded to OSADoEvent() in an applet shell # OTOH, users could just use CarbonX.AE directly for this; probably scratch this

- better handling of return values? (e.g. check return types match type specified in [terminology] definition) -- note: think it should be left to developer to return correct type(s), so probably scratch this

- get standard event & coercion handlers; install/remove/get special event handlers -- TO DECIDE: are 'get' functions worth doing?

- any other coercions to install as standard (e.g. unicode to int, real)

- handle incoming events' send flags? (If so, How?)

- maybe create a Python code generator that parses an sdef and generates all the installeventhandler() code automatically for convenience (note: generated code could be in the form of a separate module that's included in application bundle and imported into the main module, rather than pasting directly into main module)

- when unpacking event parameters, ignore unknown parameters (c.f. SIG)

- also, allow callbacks to specify an optional 'parameters' parameter that will receive a dict containing all unknown params (Q. should these be automatically unpacked as-is, or left to client to unpack as desired?)

- add convenience installrunhandler, installopenhandler, installreopenhandler, installquithandler functions? (An installidlehandler would be nice, but problematic unless CarbonEvt grows support for Carbon timers.)
