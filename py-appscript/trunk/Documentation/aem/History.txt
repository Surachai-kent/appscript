HISTORY

2006-10-22 -- ???

- no longer includes BOM when packing AEDescs of typeUnicodeText as this caused problems with applications that don't handle BOMs correctly (e.g. iTunes 7)

- no longer errors when packing Python longs on Python 2.5

- now allocates and disposes a new Mach port each time an event is sent. This seems a bit wasteful; however, the performance hit is negligible, and it avoids the complexities of managing Mach ports (either manually or automatically) in multi-threaded situations. Hopefully no unexpected problems (memory leaks, etc.) will turn up with this approach; if they do, a different arrangement will have to be found. Also note that allocating a custom Mach port instead of using the default one avoids the bouncing Python launcher icon in the Dock with Python 2.4+; this also reduces the startup time.

- comparing aem references now works correctly; before, comparing equivalent references for equality could return False if one had been previously unpacked (i.e. DeferredSpecifier objects weren't being taken account of)

- next and previous references now unpack correctly (previously, selector would appear as an AEType, not four-char-code string)

- fixed endian bugs when unpacking first/middle/last/any/all specifiers, insertion loc specifiers and comparison and logic tests

- kAEContains comparison descriptors now unpack correctly as 'op2.isin(op1)' when first operator isn't an its-based aem reference

- fixed problem in aem.send.send where slicing an Exception object causes an error on Python 2.5 (now uses 'err.args[1:]' instead of 'err[1:]'); previously on 2.5, aem was failing to raise a CommandError in response to an Apple Event Manager-raised error when sending an event.

- fixed minor case-sensitivity issue in findapp ('.app' suffixes were previously assumed to always be lowercase)

- fixed case-sensitivity issue in aem.send.connect._psnForApplicationPath (previously it lowercased file paths)

- changed aem.launch into static method of aem.Application class


2006-08-08 -- 0.11.0

- renamed ApplicationError class to CommandError

- added launch(path) function

- added isrunning() method to Application class for determining if target application is running

- added reconnect() method to Application class for manually updating Application object's typeProcessSerialNumber AEAddressDesc should it become out of date (which happens if the target application has been restarted since the Application object was created)

- Application objects are now comparable and hashable

- improved application launching code (now uses Process Manager's LaunchApplication)

- local applications are now always identified by process serial number when 'path' argument is used in Application.__init__() (previously aem would use creator type if one existed, which can't distinguish between application versions)

- simplified class hierarchy in aem.types.objectspecifiers.specifier; relaxed rules on which reference form properties and methods are available on which specifier classes; specifier classes now implement comparison and logic operator methods though these should only be used on its-based references

- doubled performance of objectspecifier modules when unpacking and repacking specifiers

- revised parameters in Event._createAppleEvent, Event._sendAppleEvent hooks

- added optional codecs parameter to Application.event()

- now uses AESendMessage instead of AESend (much faster)

- now includes BOM when packing AEDescs of typeUnicodeText


2006-03-25 -- 0.10.4
- fixed endian bugs when packing and unpacking dates

2006-03-11 -- 0.10.3
- now supports Intel Macs
- Python longs now pack as typeSInt64 (previously typeSInt32) where possible, and as typeIEEE64BitFloatingPoint otherwise
- changed from LGPL to MIT license

2006-01-05 -- 0.10.2
- byrange() now accepts either con-based or app-based references (former are normally used, but latter are legal)

2005-12-08 -- 0.10.1
- moved OS 10.2 'event hanging' bug workaround to aem.sendsafe module as it interferes with operation of PyObjC-based apps; OS 10.2 users must now import this module explicitly before using aem/appscript

2005-11-15 -- 0.10.0
- now uses CarbonX.AE instead of Carbon.AE
- Event class now exposes reserved AEM_event attribute containing AppleEvent descriptor (note: this may change)
- ApplicationError class's string representation now provides more meaningful generic descriptions for default Cocoa Scripting NS...Error messages
- added AEEventName class

2005-10-27 -- 0.9.0
- added k.RequestedType, k.Ignore, k.Case, k.Diacriticals, k.Expansion, k.Punctuation, k.Hyphens, k.Whitespace constants
- removed 'resulttype' arg from Event constructor; users should now pass this value via 'atts' arg instead

2005-07-15 -- 0.8.1
- AEType, AEEnum, etc. now show 'aem.' prefix in repr() string

2005-07-11 -- 0.8.0
- modified aem.send.send to ignore any returned error info when error number = 0 ('no error', e.g. see Finder's duplicate, move commands)
- renamed Application.event()'s 'type' parameter to 'resulttype'
- eliminated macerrors dependency as non-ASCII comments in that module (Apple-installed Python 2.3.5, OS 10.4) cause warnings
- added typeUTF8Text, typeUTF16ExternalRepresentation unpackers
- added a few minimal OS error code descriptions

2005-06-22 -- 0.7.1
- changed AEM_resolve() so each call is applied to the result of the previous call (previously sent all calls to a single object)

2005-06-09 -- 0.7.0
- Python 2.4 support (LaunchServices is in different locations on 2.3 and 2.4, so aem now tries to import from both locations)
- uses new macfile module to wrap the various AE filesystem-related types for improved ease of use
- now respects optional BOM when unpacking AEDescs of typeUnicodeText
- smarter packing of Python longs as [non-lossy] int when possible and [lossy] float if not
- now packs datetime.time as typeLongDateTime (uses current date)
- start and end properties now available on all position specifier forms, allowing references like ref.elements(cParagraph).byindex(1).end (obscure, but supported by some apps)
- combined Event() constructor's eventclass and eventid parameters into one
- revised Event.send() parameters

2005-04-17 -- 0.6.1
- renamed send() method's 'astype' argument to 'type'
- renamed ApplicationError.rawreply to ApplicationError.raw
- renamed AEFourLetterCode to AETypeBase
- aem now exports AETypeBase (previously AEFourLetterCode) correctly for type-checking use
- added aem.send.errors module containing generic descriptions for application scripting-related Carbon MacOS errors (aem.send previously got descriptions from macerrors, which sucks)
- documented hooks in Application and Event classes
- added note about transactions to manual

2005-04-10 -- 0.6.0
- removed aem.receive as it needs a serious rethink/redesign
- users can now use 'import aem' instead of 'import aem.send
- import aem.types'
- fixed bug in Root.__hash__() so references can now be hashed
- removed Root.help() as it's not all that useful
- rearranged specifier module's inheritance tree so ElementsByRange now supports byfilter() method
- ApplicationError is now subclass of MacOS.Error
- inserted hooks into Application and Event classes, allowing clients to provide their own functions for creating and sending Apple events by subclassing them
- miscellaneous renamings and rearrangings and additional commenting of code to make it easier for maintainers/porters to follow

2005-02-03 -- 0.5.1
- now works with official LaunchServices package
- improved error message when scripts are run without a Window Manager connection
- added note on Window Manager issue to documentation

2005-01-25 -- 0.5.0

- revised aem.send API

2004-10-19
- fixed bug in Application class where __del__ would fail if an error occurred in __init__
- Application constructor now also takes AEAddressDescs

2004-09-22
- improved Codecs.pack() method now checks supplied values both by __class__ attribute and by isinstance() function, e.g. a value whose class is a subclass of UserDict will now be packed as a dict instead of raising a TypeError
- now packs values of type time.struct_time

2004-09-13
- changed order of arguments in AEHandlerManager.add()

2004-09-08
- added AEM_resolve() to object specifiers
- Codecs class now used to supply [default, overrideable] app, con, its objects when unpacking object specifiers
