<h2>The <code>Application</code> class</h2>

<pre><code>Application -- the target application

    Attributes:

        _Event : Event -- Event class to be instantiated by
                Application.event(); Application subclasses may
                override this [1]
    
    Methods:

        __init__(path=None, url=None, desc=None, codecs=aem.types.Codecs())
            path : string | None -- full path to local application
                    (e.g. '/Applications/TextEdit.app')
            url : string | None -- url for remote process
                    (e.g. 'eppc://user:pass@0.0.0.1/TextEdit')
            desc : AEAddressDesc | None -- AEAddressDesc for application
            codecs : aemtypes.Codecs -- used to convert Python values
                    to AEDescs and back

        event(...) -- construct an Apple event (see next chapter for details)

        starttransaction() -- start a new transaction; all Events
                constructed after starttransaction() is called will
                belong to the same transaction until endtransaction()
                is called [4]

        endtransaction() -- end the current transaction [4]

        launch(path) -- launch an application in background if not
                already running, and send it a 'ascrnoop' event
            path : FSRef | str -- path to application, 
                e.g. '/Applications/TextEdit.app'

        isrunning() -- Is the targetted application currently running?
                (Note: this only works for Application objects specified
                by path, not by URL or AEDesc.)
            Result : bool -- False if target application is not running
                    or is running under a different process ID, else True

        reconnect() -- Make sure this Application object has the current
                process ID for the target application, relaunching the
                target application if it's not currently running.
                (Note: this only works for Application objects specified
                by path, not by URL or AEDesc.)</code></pre>



<p>Note: During a transaction, sending the application an event not created during that transaction will cause an error. Similarly, sending the application an event created during a transaction after that transaction has ended will cause an error. Keeping track of this is the user's responsibility.</p>
