TO DO

- Replace CarbonX.AE's AEInstallSpecialHandler and AERemoveSpecialHandler functions with stubs that raise NotImplementedError. (See <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/IAC/IAC-118.html> for more info.)

- fix malloc warnings in OSA extension in Python 2.5

- close component instance upon OSAObj_dealloc()

- OSALoadFile should probably take storable as argument as well as return it as a result

- AEGetEventHandler(), AEGetSpecialHandler(), AEGetCoercionHandler()  functions will crash when getting C callbacks; will this be a practical issue, or can it be ignored?

- Add standard AE and OSA error codes to kAE and kOSA (wonder why they're not already included?)

- Finish AE-over-mach-ports support.

- Add some/all component manager calls to OSAComponentInstance, e.g. GetComponentInfo() (which even Carbon.Cm.ComponentInstance omits); if making OSAComponentInstance a subtype of ComponentInstance is too hard (as is indicated) then either copy-n-paste the relevant functions or import Carbon.Cm and implement wrapper methods that forward operations to a Cm.CI instance. Alternatively, add a method that returns a Carbon.Cm.ComponentInstance.

- check deprecation warnings on Intel Mac for FMGetFontFamilyName and FMGetFontFamilyFromName in ParseStyle.c and BuildStyle.c
