TO DO

- Allow comparison of File objects specifying non-existent files/folders/disks. (Currently throws MacOS error.)

- Allow Alias and File objects to be created using relative POSIX paths? Or is it best (i.e. safest) to insist on absolute paths and leave user to perform any other expansions for themselves?

- Decide if File objects should be completely non-deterministic; currently File objects created from an FSRef/AEDesc of typeFSRefwill retain and reuse that original object, which will cause problems if the specified item is subsequently moved or deleted. (FSSpecs may also have problems due to the way the Carbon.File extension is implemented.)

- How to handle other attributes of file URLs (e.g. host address), if at all?

- Alias and File classes should have identical APIs
