TO DO

- get rid of 'telltarget' (cf rb-appscript)


- app('Finder').processes() should now work but doesn't (error -1799 occurs). Find out why.


- Relaunching an application immediately after quitting it often results in an invalid connection error (-609) as LaunchApplication is being called before the application has actually quit. Not sure if there's a practical solution to this - users may just have to live with it.


- Update everything for AS-style built-in type/enum names


- Allow apps to be identified by unix process id. 


- Allow multiple instances of same application to be launched and/or controlled.


- Introspection support. Users should be able to examine both references' structure and obtain terminology for the referenced properties and elements.


- aemcodegen should probably show 'subj' attribute


- Finish Problem Apps chapter


- Improve osadict to provide htmldoc export option, interactive option


- Get all documentation online.


- Proper tests.


- See modules for additional TO DO/TO CHECK/TO DECIDE comments.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: probably reject the following:

- better type-checking for 'ignore' and 'resulttype' args?
