Appscript is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities (a.k.a. Distutils). To install appscript, cd to the appscript-0.21.0 directory and run:

	python setup.py install

Setuptools will be used if available, otherwise the setup.py script will revert to distutils.

Building appscript from source requires the gcc compiler (supplied with Apple's Developer Tools). Setuptools is available from <http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi>. (Note: Python 2.6.3 does not work correctly with setuptools; this and other issues are addressed in 2.6.4.)

Mac OS X 10.6 users: You will need to install the Mac OS X 10.4u SDK (included in the Xcode 3.2 installer) before you can build py-appscript for python.org's Python framework distributions, which are built with the 10.4 SDK. In addition, gcc 4.0, not the default 4.2, must be used to build extensions against the 10.4 SDK (note: Python 2.6.4 will automatically use gcc 4.0 as necessary).

Appscript requires Python 2.3 or later and Mac OS X 10.4 or later. (Users who require Mac OS X 10.3.9 support should use appscript 0.20.3.)

This appscript distribution supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x. Documentation and sample scripts for each can be found under the appscript_2x and appscript_3x directories.

NOTES

- The aem, appscript and mactypes modules provide full 64-bit support. The osax module provides partial 64-bit support; see doc/osax-manual for details.

-------

Appscript 0.21.0 tidies up a number of deprecated APIs in appscript_2x:

	- The aem.CommandError class name has been removed. Clients should use aem.EventError instead.

	- The aem.CantLaunchApplicationError.number attribute has been removed. Clients should use aem.CantLaunchApplicationError.errornumber instead.

	- The aem.EventError.number and aem.EventError.message attributes have been removed. Clients should use aem.EventError.errornumber and aem.EventError.errormessage instead.

	- The CarbonX package has been removed. Client code that refers to CarbonX.AE and/or CarbonX.kAE should be updated to use aem.ae and/or aem.kae instead. 

	- The osax.ScriptingAddition class name is deprecated, though it remains supported on Python 2.x for backwards compatibility. Clients should use osax.OSAX instead.

--------

- Developer tools for exporting application dictionaries (ASDictionary) and converting application commands from AppleScript to appscript syntax (ASTranslate) are available separately:

	http://appscript.sourceforge.net/tools.html

- ASDictionary 0.11.3 or later is required to use appscript's built-in help() method. If ASDictionary isn't installed, interactive help won't be available but appscript will continue to operate as normal.

-------

- Appscript 0.21.0 is beta 4. Please report any problems you encounter either in the appscript bridge or in using it to control particular applications.
