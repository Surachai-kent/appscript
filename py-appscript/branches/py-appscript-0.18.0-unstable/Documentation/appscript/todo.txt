TO DO

- How should terminology module handle malformed aetes? Ignore them? Raise proper error (except for zero-length aetes, which AS seems to ignore)?


- Relaunching an application immediately after quitting it often results in an invalid connection error (-609) as LaunchApplication is being called before the application has actually quit. Not sure if there's a practical solution to this - users may just have to live with it.


- Introspection support. Users should be able to examine both references' structure and obtain terminology for the referenced properties and elements.


- More tests.


- See modules for additional TO DO/TO CHECK/TO DECIDE comments.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: probably reject the following:

- better type-checking for 'ignore' and 'resulttype' args?


- Allow multiple instances of same application to be launched and/or controlled. (Currently clients can launch new instances themselves, then create Application objects using their PIDs.)
