AppscriptHelpAgent Read Me

======================================================================
ABOUT

A faceless background application that provides support for rb-appscript's built-in help system.

Note that AppscriptHelpAgent is an optional extra and is *not* required to use rb-appscript. If AppscriptHelpAgent isn't installed, appscript will function as normal with any calls to its built-in help merely resulting in a 'no help available' message being displayed.

======================================================================
REQUIREMENTS

- Mac OS X 10.3+

======================================================================
INSTALLATION

Copy the AppscriptHelpAgent.app binary to your Applications folder.

======================================================================
NOTES

- No user interaction needed: appscript will launch AppscriptHelpAgent when needed, and AppscriptHelpAgent will automatically quit after 60 minutes of inactivity.

- rb-appscript support is not quite complete yet. While the -o, -k, -u, -t, -i and -r all display the desired rb-appscript style terminology, the -s option currently displays Python-style, not Ruby-style, values. Additionally, AppscriptHelpAgent currently displays a Python-style, not Ruby-style, appscript reference at the start of each help listing. These issues will be addressed in future releases.

- To build from source, cd to the AppscriptHelpAgent/src directory and run:

	python setup.py py2app

Requires appscript 0.18.0 or later, PyObjC and py2app.
