TO DO

- finish integrating helpsystem module (including support/drop -s option for commands)

- finish rb-appscript support: -s option should display Ruby-style values, show Ruby-style reference at start of each help listing

- modify osadict to use standard OS X Python installation only (or rewrite in C?), and add corresponding 'ASHAOSAD' handler to AHA
