TO DO


- finish sub-interpreter support


- add support for a config.py module that can be located at [~]/Library/PyOSA/2.x? If present, this would be executed each time a new script was created and would have access to PyOSA APIs, allowing additional configuration to be done (e.g. loading event handler definitions).


- OSA library support?


- ability to run scripts starting with '#!...python' in non-OSA mode; i.e. a python subprocess, with run event's args (if any) passed to ARGV, and stdout and stderr piped to script results and script errors respectively


- see also comments in source code


- anything else?
