# Called each time a component instance is opened, allowing sys.path to be configured
# for PyOSA. It then verifies that a compatible version of appscript is available.
#

# TO DO: including prebuilt appscript packages, one for each Python version, and
# having PyOSA load one of those may be worth exploring as an alternative to relying
# on users to install appscript separately.
