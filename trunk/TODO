TO DO

- fix malloc warnings in osa extension in Python 2.5

- close component instance upon OSAObj_dealloc()

- OSALoadFile should probably take storable as argument as well as return it as a result

- Add some/all component manager calls to OSAComponentInstance, e.g. GetComponentInfo() (which even Carbon.Cm.ComponentInstance omits); if making OSAComponentInstance a subtype of ComponentInstance is too hard (as is indicated) then either copy-n-paste the relevant functions or import Carbon.Cm and implement wrapper methods that forward operations to a Cm.CI instance. Alternatively, add a method that returns a Carbon.Cm.ComponentInstance.

- implement new 10.5 APIs

- 64-bit support

- following fails on Python 2.5:

	OSASetResumeDispatchProc((kOSAUseStandardDispatch, kOSADontUsePhac))
