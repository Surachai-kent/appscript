- add 'result' tab allowing users to view script's result value as-per Script Editor

- users should be able to independently select formats for both input and output panes, e.g. to convert from py-appscript to AppleScript, rb-appscript to py-appscript, etc.

- Following AppleScript:

	tell application "Finder" to count Finder windows

translates to:

	app(u'/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app').count(each=k.Finder_window)

However, Finder requires:

	app(u'/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app').count(None, each=k.Finder_window)
