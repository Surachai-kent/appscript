aemreceive is packaged using the standard Python Distribution Utilities (a.k.a. Distutils). To install appscript, cd to the aemreceive-0.x.x directory and run:

	python setup.py install

Setuptools will be used if available, otherwise the setup.py script will revert to distutils.


This will build and open a binary installer for the appscript packages, documentation and examples.

aemreceive requires MacPython 2.3 or later and Mac OS X 10.3 or later.

Python 3.0 is currently not supported.

DEPENDENCIES

- py-appscript 0.19.0+ <http://appscript.sourceforge.net>

NOTES

- Provides basic support for handling Apple events.

- aemreceive should now provide full 64-bit support with the exception of the optional aemreceive.sfba module (used to implement scriptable faceless background applications, typically used as AppleScript extensions), which is 32-bit only due to its use of Python's 32-bit Carbon.CarbonEvt extension to provide a main event loop.

- note that sfba/CarbonEvt don't support background threads. Applications requiring multi-threading support can use PyObjC to provide a run loop instead.
