About ASDictionary
==================

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text 
or HTML format. Requires Mac OS X 10.12 or later. 


Exporting application dictionaries
----------------------------------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications 
   or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or 
   scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export 
   window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-
   based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option 
   to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 
   'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) 
   Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands 
   in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


Scripting ASDictionary
----------------------

ASDictionary provides a single AppleScript command, 'export', for exporting 
application and scripting addition dictionaries. For example:

tell application "ASDictionary"
  export {POSIX file "/System/Applications/Calendar.app", 
           POSIX file"/System/Applications/Music.app"}
         to POSIX file "/Users/jsmith/Documents"
         using file formats {single file HTML, frame based HTML}
         with exporting to subfolders
end tell

See ASDictionary's built-in dictionary for more information.


Notes
-----

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting 
  dictionaries.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness 
  may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the 
  additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application 
  dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. 
  Should this happen, try exporting the dictionary as plain text instead.

- The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support 
  their built-in help systems. You can specify text wrapping options for help 
  system output in ASDictionary's Preferences window.
