''TO DO

- there is a problem where a 'export dictionaries' command sent immediately after launching results in an 'unknown command' (-1708) error; not sure why but need to find out and fix; in the meantime, clients should add a delay inbetween launching and calling the command as a workaround

- add plain text and frame-based HTML export options to asdict

- allow users to export dictionaries for remote applications (10.4+ only)

- allow users to import/export sdefs

- (full sdef support in osaterminology)

- add private support for objc-appscript's osaglue tool (note: this can't happen until objc-appscript's API is stable)
