TO DO

- the application reference displayed at start of each help listing should appear in Ruby, not Python, format when rb-appscript style is used

- the -s option should display Ruby, not Python, values when the rb-appscript style is used

- note: if PyObjC is imported before using aemreceive to install event handlers, an error -1708 (unknown event not handled) will occur when asdict/appscript launches ASDictionary to send it an event (looks like Cocoa starts handling events upon initialisation, rather than waiting until after the main event loop is started); shoud investigate this

- add public event handler: 
	
	export -- export application dictionaries
		[list of file alias] -- the applications and/or osaxen to read; if not given, use export list instead
		[to : folder alias] -- the folder to export to; if not given, the current user's desktop
		[using file formats : list of 'plain text', 'single file HTML', 'frame based HTML']
		[using styles : list of 'AppleScript', 'py appscript', 'rb appscript', 'objc appscript']
		[compact classes : <boolean>]
		[show invisibles : <boolean>]
	Result: list of record -- error info for any applications/osaxen that failed to export, as {file: <alias>, description: <string>}
