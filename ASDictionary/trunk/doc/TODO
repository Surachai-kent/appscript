- allow users to export dictionaries for remote applications (10.4+ only)

- allow users to import/export sdefs

- full sdef support (see py-appscript's osaterminology package)

- add scripting addition support to asdict's viewer modes

- better objc-appscript support in asdict (requires improvements to appscriptsupport.py)
