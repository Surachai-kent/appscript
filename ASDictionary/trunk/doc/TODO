TO DO

- There is a problem where an 'export' command sent immediately after launching results in an 'unknown command' (-1708) error, apparently due to the application starting to handle incoming Apple events before the 'ASDiExpD' Apple event handler is installed. Not sure why but need to find out and fix; in the meantime, clients should add a (1 sec?) delay inbetween launching ASDictionary and calling the 'export' command as a workaround. Note: this problem also affects py-appscript, rb-appscript and asdict, which use ASDictionary's private Apple event APIs.

- add frame-based HTML export option to asdict

- allow users to export dictionaries for remote applications (10.4+ only)

- allow users to import/export sdefs

- full sdef support (see py-appscript's osaterminology package)

- add scripting addition support to asdict's viewer modes

- fix class name capitalisation for objc-appscript style dictionaries

- asdict should allow users to specify a class name prefix when exporting objc-appscript style dictionaries

- better rendering of Ruby dates
