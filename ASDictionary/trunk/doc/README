ASDictionary

-----------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. Requires Mac OS 10.3 or later. 

-----------------------------------
USAGE

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.

-----------------------------------
NOTES

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.
