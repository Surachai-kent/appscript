ASDictionary

-----------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. Requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. 


-----------------------------------
USAGE

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


-----------------------------------
APPSCRIPT SUPPORT

The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support their built-in help systems. You can set the preferences for ASDictionary's appscript support via its Preferences window. 

In particular, rb-appscript users should check that the 'Ruby interpreter' option provides a valid path to a ruby interpreter (the default is /usr/bin/ruby), and ensure the Ruby installation used by that interpreter has rb-appscript installed. If a valid interpreter path is not given, or the Ruby installation specified does not have rb-appscript installed, rb-appscript's help system will display references and values using Python rather than Ruby syntax.


-----------------------------------
COMMAND LINE SUPPORT

The optional asdict command-line tool can be used to:

- export application dictionaries as plain text and HTML files
- view individual suite, class and command definitions
- display inheritance and containment trees.

Like ASDictionary, asdict supports AppleScript- and appscript-style terminology and can operate in both interactive and non-interactive modes. 

To install asdict, cd to the ASDictionary-0.9.0/bin folder in Terminal.app and run:

	sudo cp asdict /usr/local/bin && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/asdict

To view the full documentation for asdict, run:

	/usr/local/bin/asdict -h


-----------------------------------
NOTES

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting dictionaries.

- AppleScript and appscript users can also export application and scripting dictionaries using ASDictionary's 'export' command. See ASDictionary's own dictionary for details.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.
