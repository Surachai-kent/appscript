ASDictionary

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT

ASDictionary exports scriptable Mac applications' dictionaries in plain text or HTML format. It can also be used to generate application 'glues' for use with objc-appscript. Requires Mac OS 10.3.9 or later. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

To install ASDictionary, simply open the ASDictionary-0.12.0.dmg and drag the ASDictionary application to your Applications folder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

------- To export application dictionaries -------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select one or more file formats: plain text, single-file HTML and/or frame-based HTML. If an HTML format is chosen, check the 'Compact classes' option to combine duplicate classes into one. (For example, TextEdit defines a 'document' class in its Standard Suite, and again in its TextEdit Suite.) Check the 'Show invisibles' option to include hidden classes and commands in HTML output.

3. Select one or more terminology styles.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated files.


------- To generate objc-appscript glues -------

1. Use the 'Dictionary' menu to select one or more scriptable applications or scripting additions, or drag-and-drop one or more application and/or scripting addition files onto ASDictionary's application icon or Export window.

2. Select the objc-appscript glue format.

3. The ObjC class name prefix for each glue is shown in the Prefix column. The default prefix is an abbreviation of the application's name (e.g. Address Book becomes AB, iCal becomes IC), but this can be changed by clicking on it and typing a prefix of your choice. Take care not to use a prefix that may cause the glue's class names to collide with existing Cocoa classes (e.g. 'NS' is a particularly common prefix and best avoided) otherwise the glue may not compile.

4. Click 'Export', and select a destination folder for the generated glue. Each glue folder's name will consist of its class name prefix followed by 'Glue' (e.g. AddressBookGlue, ICGlue).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
APPLESCRIPT SUPPORT

ASDictionary provides a single AppleScript command, 'export', for exporting application and scripting addition dictionaries. For example:

tell application "ASDictionary"	export {POSIX file "/Applications/iCal.app", POSIX file "/Applications/iTunes.app"} Â		to POSIX file "/Users/jsmith/Documents" Â		using file formats {single file HTML, frame based HTML} Â		with exporting to subfoldersend tell

See ASDictionary's built-in dictionary for more information.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- Caution: ASDictionary will overwrite any existing files when exporting dictionaries.

- Exporting larger dictionaries may take several seconds; GUI responsiveness may be limited during this time. HTML export options take longer due to the additional processing involved.

- While ASDictionary is fairly tolerant of weird and buggy application dictionaries, HTML generation may fail on a few especially strange ones. Should this happen, please submit a bug report.

Appscript Support

The appscript bridges for Python and Ruby depend on ASDictionary to support their built-in help systems. You can specify text wrapping options for help system output in ASDictionary's Preferences window.
